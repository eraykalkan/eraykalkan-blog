Let's start with what the heap is.
The binary heap is a data structure that can be considered as a complete binary tree where each node of the tree represents an element of the array.

In this algorithm:

1) Build the heap using the given elements.
2) Create MAX HEAP to sort the elements in ascending order.
3) Once the heap is created, swap the root node with last node and delete the last node from the heap.

For example our elements are; 8 11 5 6 1 3 4 9

Let's create our binary tree
